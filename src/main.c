//  PURPOSE:  To repeatedly ask the user the text "Please enter ", followed
//  by the text in 'descriptionCPtr', followed by the numbers 'low' and
//  'high', and to get an entered integer from the user.  If this entered
//  integer is either less than 'low', or is greater than 'high', then
//  the user is asked for another number.  After the user finally enters
//  a legal number, this function returns that number.

//  PURPOSE:  To use the function obtainNumberBetween() to obtain the values
//      for global variable 'low' (which must be between RANGE_LOWEST and
//       RANGE_HIGHEST), global variable 'high' (which must be between 'low'
//       and RANGE_HIGHEST), and local variable 'numNum' (which must be between
//       MIN_NUM_NUMBERS and MAX_NUM_NUMBERS).
//       Then it enters a loop asking the user what they want to do.  If the
//       user chooses integer 1 then the program runs countWithList(numNums).
//       If the user chooses integer 2 then the program runs
//       countWithTree(numNums).  If the user chooses 0 then the program quits.
//       Returns 'EXIT_SUCCESS' to OS.
